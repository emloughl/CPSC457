1. 

Does the Process ID change on each run? 

- Yes, because there are many other processes currently executing on an operating system. They each get ID's, and the ID will be increasing with each process.


Does the parent process ID ever change? 

- No. It always remains as 1.


2. FORK:

- If the result of fork is negative, it means failed to fork. If it is zero, then this means that the child 
 created it. If it is above zero, then it was created by the parent.
